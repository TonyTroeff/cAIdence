## Types

- Always use interfaces to describe objects
- Use types for something simpler (for example `type Option = 'yes' | 'no';` or `type Variant = ITrack | IPlaylist`)
- Never use "any" or "unknown" or "never"

# Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS
- Ensure the design is responsive and works well on mobile and desktop
- Maintain a clean, modern aesthetic consistent with a music application
- Use appropriate spacing, typography, and color scheme
